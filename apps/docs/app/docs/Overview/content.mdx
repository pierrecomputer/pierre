## Overview

  Diffs is in early active development—APIs are subject to change.
</Notice>

**Diffs** is a library for rendering code and diffs on the web. This includes
both high-level, easy-to-use components, as well as exposing many of the
internals if you want to selectively use specific pieces. We've built syntax
highlighting on top of [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) which provides a lot of
great theme and language support.

<MultiFileDiff
  {...initialDiffProps}
  className="overflow-hidden rounded-md border-1 contain-layout contain-paint"
/>

We have an opinionated stance in our architecture: **browsers are rather
efficient at rendering raw HTML**. We lean into this by having all the lower
level APIs purely rendering strings (the raw HTML) that are then consumed by
higher-order components and utilities. This gives us great performance and
flexibility to support popular libraries like React as well as provide great
tools if you want to stick to vanilla JavaScript and HTML. The higher-order
components render all this out into Shadow DOM and CSS grid layout.

Generally speaking, you're probably going to want to use the higher level
components since they provide an easy-to-use API that you can get started with
rather quickly. We currently only have components for vanilla JavaScript and
React, but will add more if there's demand.

For this overview, we'll talk about the vanilla JavaScript components for now
but there are React equivalents for all of these.

## Rendering diffs

Our goal with visualizing diffs was to provide some flexible and approachable
APIs for _how_ you may want to render diffs. For this, we provide a component
called `FileDiff`.

There are two ways to render diffs with `FileDiff`:

1. Provide two versions of a file or code snippet to compare
2. Consume a patch file

You can see examples of these approaches below, in both JavaScript and React.

<CodeToggle
  reactSingleFile={reactSingleFile}
  reactPatchFile={reactPatchFile}
  vanillaSingleFile={vanillaSingleFile}
  vanillaPatchFile={vanillaPatchFile}
/>
