## Core Types

Before diving into the components, it's helpful to understand the two core data
structures used throughout the library.

### FileContents

`FileContents` represents a single file. Use it when rendering a file with the
`<File>` component, or pass two of them as `oldFile` and `newFile` to diff
components.

<DocsCodeExample {...fileContentsType} />

### FileDiffMetadata

`FileDiffMetadata` represents the differences between two files. It contains the
hunks (changed regions), line counts, and optionally the full file contents for
expansion.

**Tip:** You can generate `FileDiffMetadata` using
[`parseDiffFromFile`](#utilities-parsedifffromfile) (from two file versions) or
[`parsePatchFiles`](#utilities-parsepatchfiles) (from a patch string).

<DocsCodeExample {...fileDiffMetadataType} />

### Creating Diffs

There are two ways to create a `FileDiffMetadata`.

#### From Two Files

Use `parseDiffFromFile` when you have both file versions. This approach includes
the full file contents, enabling the "expand unchanged" feature.

<DocsCodeExample {...parseDiffFromFileExample} />

#### From a Patch String

Use `parsePatchFiles` when you have a unified diff or patch file. This is useful
when working with git output or patch files from APIs.

<DocsCodeExample {...parsePatchFilesExample} />

**Tip:** If you need to change the language after creating a `FileContents` or
`FileDiffMetadata`, use the
[`setLanguageOverride`](#utilities-setlanguageoverride) utility function.
