## Vanilla JS API

<Notice icon={<IconInfoFill />}>
  Import vanilla JavaScript classes, components, and methods from

</Notice>

### Components

The Vanilla JS API exposes two core components: `FileDiff` (compare two file
versions or render a pre-parsed `FileDiffMetadata`) and `File` (render a single
code file without diff). Typically you'll want to interface with these as
they'll handle all the complicated aspects of syntax highlighting, theming, and
full interactivity for you.

<VanillaComponentTabs
  fileDiffExample={fileDiffExample}
  fileExample={fileExample}
/>

### Props

Both `FileDiff` and `File` accept an options object in their constructor. The
`File` component has similar options, but excludes diff-specific settings and
uses `LineAnnotation` instead of `DiffLineAnnotation` (no `side` property).

<VanillaPropTabs fileDiffProps={fileDiffProps} fileProps={fileProps} />

#### Custom Hunk Separators

If you want to render custom hunk separators that won't scroll with the content,
there are a few tricks you will need to employ. See the following code snippet:

<DocsCodeExample {...customHunk} />

### Renderers

<Notice icon={<IconInfoFill />}>
  For most use cases, you should use the higher-level components like `FileDiff`
  and `File` (vanilla JS) or the React components (`MultiFileDiff`, `FileDiff`,
  `PatchDiff`, `File`). These renderers are low-level building blocks intended
  for advanced use cases.
</Notice>

These renderer classes handle the low-level work of parsing and rendering code
with syntax highlighting. Useful when you need direct access to the rendered
output as [HAST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) nodes or HTML strings for
custom rendering pipelines.

#### DiffHunksRenderer

Takes a `FileDiffMetadata` data structure and renders out the raw HAST
(Hypertext Abstract Syntax Tree) elements for diff hunks. You can generate
`FileDiffMetadata` via `parseDiffFromFile` or `parsePatchFiles` utility
functions.

<DiffHunksTabs
  diffHunksRenderer={diffHunksRenderer}
  diffHunksRendererPatch={diffHunksRendererPatch}
/>

#### FileRenderer

Takes a `FileContents` object (just a filename and contents string) and renders
syntax-highlighted code as HAST elements. Useful for rendering single files
without any diff context.
