## Styling

Diff and code components are rendered using shadow DOM APIs, allowing styles to
be well-isolated from your page's existing CSS. However, it also means you may
have to utilize some custom CSS variables to override default styles. These can
be done in your global CSS, as style props on parent components, or on the
`FileDiff` component directly.

### Advanced: Unsafe CSS [toc-ignore]

For advanced customization, you can inject arbitrary CSS into the shadow DOM
using the `unsafeCSS` option. This CSS will be wrapped in an `@layer unsafe`
block, giving it the highest priority in the cascade. Use this sparingly and
with caution, as it bypasses the normal style isolation.

We also recommend that any CSS you apply uses simple, direct selectors targeting
the existing data attributes. Avoid structural selectors like `:first-child`,
`:last-child`, `:nth-child()`, sibling combinators (`+` or `~`), deeply nested
descendant selectors, or bare tag selectors—these are susceptible to breaking in
future versions or in edge cases that may be difficult to anticipate.
