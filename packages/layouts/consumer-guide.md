# Consumer controls and persistence

A split-pane layout engine with tabs, resize controls, and a React view. The
root entry has no DOM or React dependency. The package is private.

## Customize a header

Pass `renderHeader` to `Layout` to replace the default header. The callback
receives the pane, its stack, its visible tabs, its outer edges, and its focus,
zoom, and collapse state. It also receives `select`, `close`, and `canClose`
controls.

```tsx
<Layout
  store={store}
  loneTabStrip
  animate={false}
  renderPane={(pane) => <Document id={pane.id} />}
  renderHeader={(header) => (
    <div {...header.tablistProps}>
      {header.tabs.map((tab) => (
        <button key={tab.id} {...header.getTabProps(tab)}>
          {tab.id}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

Spread `tablistProps` on the tab strip and `getTabProps(tab)` on each tab to
retain accessible roles, keyboard navigation, selection, and pointer drag. Mark
a close control inside a tab with `data-layout-tab-close` so that it does not
start a drag. A custom header owns its markup and styling. A hidden tab keeps
its content, but has no header.

`loneTabStrip` gives a pane outside a stack one tab. Without it, the default
header keeps its title. A dragged tab can join another group, reorder within a
strip, or split at a pane edge. The outer 28% of the width and 30% of the height
are edge drop zones; the center joins a group.

Pane hosts retain `data-layout-pane` and expose `data-layout-edges` as a
space-separated list of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. `computeCSSLayout`
returns the same edge flags. A zoomed pane touches every edge. Zoom keeps
keyboard focus outside the layout when focus starts there.

`animate={false}` disables both layout and zoom animations. The existing
`{ layout: false }` and `{ zoom: false }` controls remain available. The
`/consumer.html` demo shows custom headers and resize reporting. The modal and
drawer entries remain separate.

## Store and reconcile a tree

`store.toStoredTree()` returns `{ version: 3, root }`. It excludes window focus
and zoom. Parse untrusted data with `parseStoredLayoutTree(value, model)` before
passing it to `store.setStoredTree(tree)`. Parsing rejects unknown fields and
invalid nodes with `InvalidLayoutTreeError`, which includes the field path. The
default parser model is `naryTree`; pass `binaryTree` when the consumer uses it.
The existing `serialize` and `restore` methods still include local focus and
zoom.

`defaultLayoutTree(tabIds)` creates one group, one pane, or `null` for an empty
list. `reconcileLayoutTree(root, tabIds, model)` removes closed tabs and appends
new tabs to the first group without selecting them. It retains the arrangement
of surviving tabs. If no tab survives, it builds the default tree. Its default
model is also `naryTree`.

`toLayoutNodeView(root)` gives a compact read form: groups have `tabs` and
`active`; splits have a `row` or `column` direction, sizes, and children.
`fromLayoutNodeView` rebuilds that trusted form with deterministic node IDs. The
read form omits size constraints and hidden/collapsed state. Use
`StoredLayoutTree` for full persistence.

## Apply operations

```ts
const next = applyLayoutOperations(
  root,
  [
    { op: 'open', tab: 'preview', place: { beside: 'editor', edge: 'right' } },
    { op: 'resize', tab: 'editor', sizes: [2, 1] },
  ],
  { model: naryTree, maxGroups: 12 }
);
```

Operations open, select, close, move, or resize tabs and groups. A place is
`{ into: tabId, index? }` or `{ beside: tabId, edge }`. An open without a place
appends to the first group. Opening an existing tab is idempotent.
`select: true` activates an opened tab. A move into a group does not activate
it. Direct `store.addTab` and `store.moveToStack` calls retain their existing
activation default; pass `{ activate: false }` to change it.

The batch runs against an isolated store and returns a new tree only if every
operation succeeds. `LayoutOperationError.code` is `tab_not_found`,
`invalid_place`, `layout_limit`, `last_tab`, or `invalid_sizes`. `maxGroups` is
optional; the default has no group limit. The default operation model is
`naryTree`. Closing the last tab through an operation is an error;
reconciliation can return `null` for an empty tab list.

## Save resize changes

`Layout.onResize(sizes)` reports changed split IDs and their sizes once after a
completed pointer drag, and after each keyboard resize that changes a size. A
cancelled drag reports nothing. Programmatic store updates do not call it.

Use `splitAddressOf(root, splitId)` to convert a reported split ID into
`{ tab, level }`, then persist `{ op: 'resize', ...address, sizes }`. Level zero
names the split directly above the tab's group. Higher levels name its
ancestors. Each child has a positive weight or `{ px: nonNegativePixels }`; the
count must match the split's children. Storage and network writes remain the
consumer's responsibility.
